Abstract


Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have attracted increasing attention due to the improved
performance provided by the miniaturisation of electric propulsion. With the increasing
demand for high performance MAVs, traditional aircraft design methods are being replaced
with numerical optimisation approaches. Existing research in this area has not currently
extended to including propeller slipstream eects in the MAV optimisation. However, this
needs to be considered because the propeller wake can deform the wing lift distribution,
altering performance and changing the optimal MAV geometry. This thesis investigates the
importance of propeller slipstream eects on MAV design optimisation.

The influence of propeller wake on aerodynamic performance was modelled with a Higher-
Order Free Wake potential flow method. A numerical stability analysis function was created
and validated at low Reynolds numbers. These programs were then integrated into a genetic
algorithm to perform multi-objective optimisation with static stability constraints.

Three MAV congurations and two size classes (30 cm and 45 cm) were optimised, with
and without the eect of propeller slipstream. The optimisations without propeller eects
generated MAV designs with higher lift-to-drag ratios compared to published MAVs of a
similar size. The optimisations with propeller eects produced signicantly dierent optimal
designs, featuring a maximum lift-to-drag ratio 25% to 35% lower than the optimisation
without propellers for the 45 cm class. The reduction in lift-to-drag ratio was 25% less
for the 30cm class. Furthermore, propeller slipstream reduced the longitudinal stability of
the MAV, requiring changes in wing sweep and root chord to meet stability constraints.
The optimisation results suggest that the influence of geometric variables on optimisation
objectives changes with the inclusion of propeller eects. Therefore, it is important that
eects from propeller-wing interaction be included in MAV optimisations.
